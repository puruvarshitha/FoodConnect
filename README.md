This project focused on To Supply Leftover Food to the Poor, designed to address the widespread issue of food wastage and the difficulty of efficiently distributing leftover food to those in need. The project aims to create an organized, sustainable solution that minimizes food waste by redistributing surplus food to vulnerable communities, alleviating hunger, and promoting social equity. The goal is to deliver a comprehensive solution by leveraging Salesforceâ€™s powerful CRM capabilities, which include Lightning Apps, Flows, Triggers, and Reports, to automate key processes such as food collection, volunteer management, and real-time tracking of food distribution. By integrating these tools, the project will facilitate streamlined workflows, ensure data accuracy, and enable seamless coordination between volunteers, donors, and recipients.
